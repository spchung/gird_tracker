# lets_git_it

This is a simple un-opinionated workout tracking app. The main feature of this app is to collect data on your workout and present it in a calendar view.

The calendar view will look very similar to github's famous commit map. With each block replaced by a color block that represents a category of workout (leg, push. pull ... etc)

Each block's corrosponding exercises are all customable:
  - each consists of a name and working set info
    - working set info is just a representation of the exercise's current weight 
      - e.g. 12x6x3
